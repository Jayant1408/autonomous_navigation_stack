A modular end-to-end software stack for self-driving simulation, created as a capstone to the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

## Modules
- Perception (lane + object detection)
- Localization (EKF)
- Planning (FSM, trajectory)
- Control (PID, MPC)
- Simulation (CARLA or synthetic video)
